Enjoy!

# Issues
## LanguageApp (GAS) Limit Rates
This extension uses Google Apps Script's LanguageApp to do the translation.
At the moment, I have created an API endpoint with my personal Google account, so if used by many people, it may be trapped by the API's frequency limit.

(I tried to find out the specific limit rate, but it was not clear to me...)

ðŸ‘‰After all, I found that there is a API limit (10,000 requests/d?) so I'll consider the API to use...plz wait :(
