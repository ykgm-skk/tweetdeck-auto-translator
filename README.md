# Issues
## LanguageApp (GAS) Limit Rates
The API endpoint using the LanguageApp class of GAS probably has a limit rate of 10,000 times per day. Therefore, it is difficult to share one endpoint with users of this extension.

So...

### How to create a translation API endpoint with GAS
1. Access the GAS dashboard `https://script.google.com/home`
2. Create **New project**
3. Copy and paste the content of `gas/api.js` from this repository
4. Click the save button ðŸ’¾ above the editor
5. Click the **Deploy** button and select **New Deployment**
    - choose **Web app** for type, **Me** *(your e-mail address)* for "Execute as", and **Anyone** for "Who has access"
    - then click "Deploy".
6. Copy the displayed **Web app URL**, paste it into the API endpoint field of settings window.

That's all. It will work up to 10,000 translations per day.
